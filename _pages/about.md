<p align="justify">
I am a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh (SRBD). Currently, I am working on the Semantic Knowledge Graph Modeling Tool project in collaboration with Oxford Semantic Technologies (UK), which enables intuitive ontology modeling, visualization, data mapping, and advanced reasoning using RDFox.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET) under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=du_bCPIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">Dr. Kaushik Deb</a>. My broader research interests lie in Machine Learning, particularly in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Multimodal Learning. Within these areas, I am enthusiastic about adversarial machine learning, anomaly detection, generative models, and low-resource and multilingual NLP.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Alongside my research, I have strong programming skills with proficiency in C, C++, Python, Java, and SQL. I have been an active competitive programmer, solving over 2,000 problems across online judges such as Codeforces, CodeChef, and AtCoder. I have also participated in several national and divisional onsite programming contests, including ICPC regionals and IUPC. Through my academic projects, research, and extracurricular activities, I have developed strong communication, teamwork, and planning skills, enabling me to collaborate effectively in both research and software development settings.

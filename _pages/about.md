I am a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at CUET, where I am pursuing my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=du_bCPIAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Kaushik Deb </a>. I am passionate about exploring new technologies, with a particular focus on Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Digital Image Processing. My research centers on detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks, a critical area that aims to enhance the robustness and security of machine learning models.

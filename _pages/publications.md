<h1 style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Research Interest</h1>

My broad research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Some of the specific areas I am interested include:
- Adversarial Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection – studying adversarial attacks and defenses to improve the robustness and security of machine learning models.
- Multilingual and Low-Resource NLP – developing methods to efficiently utilize resources for low- and zero-resource languages.
- Multimodal Learning – integrating text, image, audio, and video modalities for improved representation and understanding.
- Generative Models – applying models such as GANs and diffusion models for intra-modal and cross-modal tasks, including high-quality image reconstruction and synthesis.
<!-- - Cross-Modal Learning, Integrating Visual, Textual, and Acoustic Data for Advanced AI Systems -->
